## Review
The package ggplot2 was created with the intention of facilitating the creation of aesthetic and informative graphics based on the book "The Grammar of Graphics". The package is relatively straight forward to use, however, I am still in the process of learning all the possible functions within it. I really like how this package can help me quickly create beautiful graphics with great simplicity.
